BSFilter - Gotta block 'em all!
================================
A Chrome extension that removes bullshit (BS) from the Internet.


Overview
--------------------------

The internet is full of bullshit and bullshitters. So much so, that even researchers took notice:

- https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit

BSFilter removes bullshit from the internet so you can get to normal watching funny cat GIFs.


Features
--------------------------

* Detects instances of bullshit on web pages.
* Attempts to identify semantically sections of the page likely to contain bullshit reference and removes them from the page.
* Sensitivity settings to customize the aggressiveness of the filter - remove single references, chunks or the entire page.


~~Installation (for Users)~~
--------------------------

~~Just install the extension from [the Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jionadcjdpdikjmgfohlohnclocfaija)!~~

~~Then surf the web as normal without worrying about bumping in to adults going mad about Bullshit.~~
