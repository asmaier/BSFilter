FilterBubble - You decide what you want to see!
================================
This Chrome extension allows you to filter out a list of words/names you don't want to see on webpages anymore. 


Overview
--------------------------

Everybody knows filter bubbles are dangerous. But they are only dangerous if 
others (or machines) decide what you have to see and what not. 
FilterBubble instead gives you back control over what you want to see. 
It filters the noise of the internet so you can see the signal again. 

Features
--------------------------

* Configurable list of names, words or phrases to blacklist
* Attemps to remove the blacklisted words with as little collateral damage as possible

~~Installation (for Users)~~
--------------------------

~~Just install the extension from [the Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jionadcjdpdikjmgfohlohnclocfaija)!~~

~~Then surf the web as normal without worrying about leaving your filter bubble.~~
